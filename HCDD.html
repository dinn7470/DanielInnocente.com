        <h1>What is Human-Centered Design and Development?</h1>
        <div class="meta">By Daniel Innocente</div>

        <h2>My Major</h2>
        <p>
            I’m currently completing my final year of my degree in Human-Centered Design and Development in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University. What a mouthful! I know. Whether I’m at a career fair, a party, or a family function – I always have the same routine prepared to explain just what it is that I’ve decided to dedicate my four years of college and possibly career to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes I describe it as “App design and development” or “Human-Computer Interaction.” These phrases get people closer to what the major actually covers, even though each one describes a slightly different piece of the larger picture.
        </p>

        <h2>What HCDD Really Means</h2>
        <p>
            Human-Centered Design and Development sits at the intersection of technology, design, psychology, and programming. It bridges the gap between understanding people and building the tools they rely on. Penn State describes the major as one that combines creativity with technical skill — helping students learn how to design digital products that actually work for the people who use them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The field is broad: part application development, part research, part design thinking. The first half focuses more on building applications, while the second half explores how people interact with them and what makes technology intuitive or frustrating.
        </p>

        <h2>Who the Program Fits</h2>
        <p>This program could be a great fit if you want to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design, build, and evaluate web, mobile, and other software applications</li>
            <li>Research users to understand how people live and how technology fits into their lives</li>
            <li>Embrace uncertainty and change on the path to getting things right</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Many people jokingly call it a “poor man’s Computer Science,” mostly because students often switch into it from Computer Science or Engineering. While CS is heavier on math and theory, HCDD focuses on front-end implementation, usability, human behavior, and design systems — all equally essential in today’s tech landscape.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Field Matters to Me</h2>
        <p>
            Living in a world dominated by technology has made me deeply curious about how people of different ages, abilities, and backgrounds use — or struggle to use — the tools around them. Designing software that is genuinely accessible and meaningful is something that motivates me every day.
        </p>
        <p>
            My coursework revolves around the Design Thinking process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Working on projects that follow this framework has helped me strengthen both my design and front-end development skills, and has made me passionate about pursuing a career grounded in Human-Centered Design.
        </p>

        <h2>My Goals Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>
            Roles in this field are often labeled “User Experience Designer,” “Product Designer,” or “UX Researcher.” They exist in nearly every industry, but the one I’m most drawn to is healthcare — where good design can genuinely impact someone’s life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Healthcare interfaces, both for providers and patients, are notoriously difficult to use. It’s ironic, considering these systems manage some of the most sensitive information a person has. My goal is to work at Epic Systems, a major electronic health record platform, where designers collaborate directly with clinicians to understand how their tools are used in real medical settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            As graduation approaches, the landscape of UX is shifting due to AI, but I remain flexible and optimistic. My hope is to contribute to medical technology that supports both providers and patients — and ultimately helps make healthcare a little more human.
