    <h1>What is Human-Centered Design and Development?</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Daniel Innocente</div>

    <p>I’m currently completing my final year of my degree in Human-Centered Design and Development in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University. What a mouthful! I know. Whether I’m at a career fair, a party, or a family function – I always have the same routine prepared to explain just what it is that I’ve decided to dedicate my four years of college and possibly career to.</p>

    <p>“App design and development”<br>“Human-Computer Interaction”</p>

    <p>These are two names I often go with that I find to be more aptly titled than what my college officially decided upon. I choose one of these because they at least gear the person I’m talking to toward technology. However beyond technology, I’ll admit that those two titles definitely describe separate aspects of what I would consider a pretty broad major. The first focuses more on applications while the second focuses on how people interact with those applications.</p>

    <p>On Penn State’s College of Information Sciences and Technology website HCDD is described as combining technology with art, design, psychology, and programming, helping you bridge the gap between front-end design and back-end tech.</p>

    <p>This program could be a great fit if you want to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Design, build, and evaluate web, mobile, and other software applications</li>
        <li>Research users to understand how people live and how technology fits into their lives</li>
        <li>Embrace uncertainty and change on the path to getting things right</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many call it a “poor man’s Computer Science.” I’ve heard this often, as many students switch from Computer Science to this program or default to it if they can’t get into Engineering. The CS degree requires more intensive math and science classes, while HCDD focuses on front-end implementation and user experience.</p>

    <p>Living in a world dominated by technology — and one that constantly evolves — has made me deeply interested in how our tools are used by diverse groups of people. Whether by age, ability, or background, I want to design software that’s easy and meaningful for anyone to use.</p>

    <p>That concept is a key facet of Human-Centered Design, explored through the Design Thinking method: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.</p>

    <p>Working on projects that use this process — while also refining my front-end development skills — has made me passionate about pursuing a career in Human-Centered Design.</p>

    <p>Roles built around design and research are often called “User Experience Designer” or “Product Designer.” These exist across industries, but the one I’m most drawn to is healthcare — where design can directly affect lives.</p>

    <p>Healthcare and medical interfaces, on both the provider and patient sides, are known for being designed poorly. I find this ironic, considering these systems handle sensitive data that should be presented clearly and intuitively.</p>

    <p>My goal is to eventually work at Epic Systems, which develops large-scale electronic health record platforms. I’m especially interested in how their designers collaborate with hospital staff to understand how their products are used in real settings.</p>

    <p>As I approach graduation, AI seems to be reshaping entry-level UX roles. Still, I remain flexible and hopeful — committed to designing medical technology that helps providers and patients alike.</p>
