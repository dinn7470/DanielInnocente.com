        <h1>When Design Hurts: How Poor UX in Healthcare Increases Cognitive Load for Clinicians</h1>
        <div class="meta">By Daniel Innocente</div>

        <h2>The Everyday Strain of Clinical Software</h2>
        <p>
            Every day, clinicians juggle multiple systems, re-enter data, and sift through floods of alerts. Many now spend more time interacting with software than with patients. What was meant to improve care has become a major source of stress — and it’s largely a design problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Electronic Health Records (EHRs) were meant to streamline care. Instead, many are cluttered, confusing, and slow. Poor layouts, redundant clicks, and buried information force clinicians to think about the interface instead of the patient. In design terms, this is cognitive overload — when mental effort exceeds capacity. In healthcare, that overload doesn’t just waste time; it risks safety.
        </p>

        <h2>Cognitive Load and Cognitive Ergonomics</h2>
        <p>
            Cognitive ergonomics focuses on designing systems that fit how humans think and process information. Unfortunately, many clinical interfaces do the opposite. Poor labeling, confusing navigation, and unnecessary popups shift mental effort from the system to the clinician. Over time, this contributes to frustration, slower workflows, and burnout.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of that, clinicians are overwhelmed with notifications. Most are irrelevant, but all demand attention. This leads to alert fatigue — when users become desensitized and begin ignoring warnings because the noise never stops. When everything appears urgent, nothing truly stands out.
        </p>

        <h2>Designing Systems That Actually Help</h2>
        <p>
            Bad healthcare design isn’t just inefficient — it’s unsafe. But thoughtful design can lighten cognitive load and restore focus during clinical tasks. Streamlining workflows, reducing redundant clicks, improving hierarchy of information, and ensuring that urgent alerts actually stand out all contribute to safer, more effective care.
        </p>
        <p>
            These aren’t cosmetic improvements — they’re safety interventions. Healthcare technology should support clinicians, not overwhelm them. Every interaction, every button, and every alert should move clinicians closer to understanding the patient, not further away.
        </p>
        <p>
            When design hurts, clinicians and patients suffer. When design helps, everyone heals a little faster.
