    <h1>When Design Hurts: How Poor UX in Healthcare Increases Cognitive Load for Clinicians</h1>
    <div class="meta">By Daniel Innocente</div>

    <p>Every day, clinicians juggle multiple systems, re-enter data, and sift through floods of alerts. Many now spend more time interacting with software than with patients. What was meant to improve care has become a major source of stress — and it’s largely a design problem.</p>

    <h2>The Hidden Weight of Bad Design</h2>
    <p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) were meant to streamline care. Instead, many are cluttered, confusing, and slow. Poor layouts, redundant clicks, and buried information force clinicians to think about the interface instead of the patient. In design terms, this is cognitive overload — when mental effort exceeds capacity. In healthcare, that overload doesn’t just waste time; it risks safety.</p>

    <h2>The Science of Cognitive Ergonomics</h2>
    <p>Cognitive ergonomics is about designing tools that match how humans think and work. But most clinical systems ignore it. Each poorly labeled button or unnecessary popup transfers complexity from the system to the user. Over time, that extra mental effort adds up to fatigue, mistakes, and burnout.</p>

    <h2>Alert Fatigue: When Everything Feels Urgent</h2>
    <p>EHRs often bombard clinicians with nonstop notifications. Most are irrelevant, but all demand attention. This constant noise causes alert fatigue — users start ignoring alerts altogether. It’s not apathy; it’s survival. When everything looks urgent, nothing truly stands out.</p>

    <h2>From Frustration to Fix</h2>
    <p>Bad healthcare design isn’t just inefficient — it’s unsafe. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Better design can lighten cognitive load and restore focus.</p>
    <p>Streamline workflows to fit real clinical tasks. Cut redundant steps and clicks. Prioritize alerts by urgency. Involve clinicians directly in the design process. These are not cosmetic tweaks; they’re safety improvements.</p>

    <h2>Design That Heals</h2>
    <p>Healthcare technology must serve people, not policies. Every pixel and workflow choice should make care simpler, faster, and safer. Because when design hurts, clinicians and patients both suffer. And when design helps, everyone heals a little faster.</p>
