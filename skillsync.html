    SkillSync was developed in the fall of 2024 during the Methods for Studying Users course (HCDD 364W), where I learned how to design with the user in mind by applying various research methods to understand user needs and create an interactive system that meets those needs.

<h1 class="problem-title">Problem</h1>
<p class="problem-description">

    Trying a new sport can feel overwhelming and intimidating, with barriers like lack of equipment, unfamiliar rules, or not knowing players of similar skill levels often discouraging participation. This creates a frustrating experience for many, especially college students eager to try new activities but held back by fear of judgment or failure. By addressing these challenges, we aim to make entering the world of sports more accessible, welcoming, and enjoyable for everyone.
<h1 class="solution-title">Solution</h1>
<p class="solution-description">
    SkillSync is a mobile application designed to pair college students that play recreational sports of a similar skill level. It is a social media platform where users can view posts from other students on their campus who are looking to make plans to play all different types of sports. Additionally, users can make posts, follow other users, and message them. One of the most significant features is that users are able to set a different skill level for themselves for each sport that they play so that they can be matched with players of similar skill levels.

<h2 class="contextual-inquiry-title">Contextual Inquiry Plan:</h2>
<p class="contextual-inquiry-description">
    In our project, we developed a contextual inquiry plan to understand the challenges college students faced when trying new sports, such as feeling intimidated by unfamiliar rules, lacking equipment, or struggling to find players of similar skill levels. We planned to observe students in campus gyms and recreational spaces, focusing on how they chose teammates, formed practice groups, and navigated skill mismatches. Our goal was to learn directly from their experiences by adopting the role of apprentices, asking open-ended questions, and watching their interactions in natural settings. This plan aimed to gather insights that would guide the design of SkillSync, a mobile app to help students connect with peers of similar skill levels and make playing sports more accessible and enjoyable.
</p>
<h3 class="questionnaire-intro">
    Before we began interviewing students, we created a questionnaire:
</h3>
<p class="questionnaire-description">
   This questionnaire allowed us to learn more about how college students play sports and what they need to make it more enjoyable. The survey asked about the sports they play, whether they prefer playing alone or with others, how important skill levels are, and if they’ve had good or bad experiences with mismatched skills. We also asked how often they play, how comfortable they feel playing with strangers, and how satisfied they are with their sports experiences. Finally, we asked what could make their experience better. These answers helped us design SkillSync to connect students with others at their skill level and improve how they enjoy sports.
</p>
<h3 class="cq-intro">
    We used our plan + questionnaire to aid us in field research:

<div class="interview-container">

    <div class="summary">
        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Dylan (Sophomore)</h2>
            <p><strong>Schedule:</strong> Visits the IM at 1:30 pm on Mon/Wed/Fri, returning from a broken toe injury.</p>
            <p><strong>Gameplay Insight:</strong> Dylan’s skill and physicality were far above Julian’s. The skill gap was evident in their game, with Dylan overpowering Julian due to his size and experience.</p>
            <p><strong>App Insight:</strong> From Dylan’s situation, a "Coming back from injury" feature should be added to the app, allowing users in recovery to connect with others in similar situations. This would help injured players ease back into the game at a comfortable pace, avoiding mismatches with fully healthy players. A similar feature could be added for users returning after long breaks from their sport.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Julian (2 years of Basketball Experience)</h2>
            <p><strong>Schedule:</strong> Occasionally visits the IM at 1:30 pm for a less crowded court.</p>
            <p><strong>Gameplay Insight:</strong> Julian enjoys playing one-on-one or small games but avoids busy times because he feels unprepared for five-on-five games. His limited experience (2 years) showed in his struggles against Dylan.</p>
            <p><strong>App Insight:</strong> Julian’s experience highlighted the need for skill-based matchmaking. The app should allow users to filter by “Years of Experience” and physical attributes (height, strength, agility, etc.) to ensure fairer, more enjoyable games for players at similar levels.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Insights from both Dylan and Julian point to the necessity of a skill-based matchmaking system in the app. Features like filtering for injury recovery, years of experience, and physical attributes will make the app more inclusive, ensuring users can find compatible opponents and teammates based on skill, experience, and physical condition.</p>
        </div>

<h2 class="themes-title">
    These insights helped us identify the following themes:

<h3 class="tasks-intro">
    With those themes in mind, we were able to identify some key features we could implement as well<br>as tasks to use to guide new research participants through our design:
