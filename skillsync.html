<p class="mindmap-description">
    SkillSync was developed in the fall of 2024 during the Methods for Studying Users course (HCDD 364W), where I learned how to design with the user in mind by applying various research methods to understand user needs and create an interactive system that meets those needs.
</p>

<h1 class="problem-title">Problem</h1>
<p class="problem-description">
    Trying a new sport can feel overwhelming and intimidating, with barriers like lack of equipment, unfamiliar rules, or not knowing players of similar skill levels often discouraging participation. This creates a frustrating experience for many, especially college students eager to try new activities but held back by fear of judgment or failure. By addressing these challenges, we aim to make entering the world of sports more accessible, welcoming, and enjoyable for everyone.
</p>

<h1 class="solution-title">Solution</h1>
<p class="solution-description">
    SkillSync is a mobile application designed to pair college students that play recreational sports of a similar skill level. It is a social media platform where users can view posts from other students on their campus who are looking to make plans to play all different types of sports. Additionally, users can make posts, follow other users, and message them. One of the most significant features is that users are able to set a different skill level for themselves for each sport that they play so that they can be matched with players of similar skill levels.

<h1 class="research-title">Research</h1>
<h2 class="contextual-inquiry-title">Contextual Inquiry Plan:</h2>
<p class="contextual-inquiry-description">
    In our project, we developed a contextual inquiry plan to understand the challenges college students faced when trying new sports, such as feeling intimidated by unfamiliar rules, lacking equipment, or struggling to find players of similar skill levels. We planned to observe students in campus gyms and recreational spaces, focusing on how they chose teammates, formed practice groups, and navigated skill mismatches. Our goal was to learn directly from their experiences by adopting the role of apprentices, asking open-ended questions, and watching their interactions in natural settings. This plan aimed to gather insights that would guide the design of SkillSync, a mobile app to help students connect with peers of similar skill levels and make playing sports more accessible and enjoyable.
</p>

<h3 class="questionnaire-intro">Before we began interviewing students, we created a questionnaire:</h3>
<p class="questionnaire-description">
    This questionnaire allowed us to learn more about how college students play sports and what they need to make it more enjoyable. The survey asked about the sports they play, whether they prefer playing alone or with others, how important skill levels are, and if they’ve had good or bad experiences with mismatched skills. We also asked how often they play, how comfortable they feel playing with strangers, and how satisfied they are with their sports experiences. Finally, we asked what could make their experience better. These answers helped us design SkillSync to connect students with others at their skill level and improve how they enjoy sports.
</p>

<h3 class="cq-intro">We used our plan + questionnaire to aid us in field research:</h3>

            <h2>Dylan (Sophomore)</h2>
            <p><strong>Schedule:</strong> Visits the IM at 1:30 pm on Mon/Wed/Fri, returning from a broken toe injury.</p>
            <p><strong>Gameplay Insight:</strong> Dylan’s skill and physicality were far above Julian’s.</p>
            <p><strong>App Insight:</strong> Add a "Coming back from injury" feature so users in recovery can connect with similar players.</p>

<h3 class="tasks-intro">
    With those themes in mind, we identified key features and tasks to guide new research participants through our design:
</h3>

<div class="content-container">
    <h2>Design Overview & Key Features</h2>
    <p>SkillSync connects college students through a skill-based matchmaking system, enhancing recreational sports experiences by reducing barriers to entry and ensuring competitive, fun games.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Matchmaking Algorithm</strong>: Suggests players based on skill level, physical attributes, and availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Organization</strong>: Allows users to follow, message, and create posts to organize games.</li>
        <li><strong>Facility Information</strong>: Provides real-time data on facility crowd levels, hours, and updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Representative Tasks</h2>
    <h3>Finding Players</h3>
    <p>Users share availability to easily find others free at the same time.</p>

    <h3>Scheduling a Game</h3>
    <p>Users specify skill levels so the app can generate fair, balanced teams.</p>

    <h3>Assembling a Consistent Team</h3>
    <p>Users follow others and organize recurring games with players of similar skill levels.</p>

    <h3>Unique Value</h3>
    <p>SkillSync’s comprehensive algorithm (skill, attributes, availability, injury status) offers a tailored sports experience.</p>
